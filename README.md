I created a mock website for a movie theater company. 

I did a lot of research from multiple sources to get this done. I implemented a lot of Bootstrap components to test them out (modal, popover, card, ect.).

This was a good test of my skills. It's always useful to try and push yourself to the point of failure to learn new things.
